# Gutenberg

This is a modified version of Gutenberg that is shipped with WordPress 6.2.

The reasons:

1. **Easier Maintainability** - Upgrading the WordPress version is a must, but with the ever-changing Gutenberg blocks, we kept needing to upgrade the CSS. With this plugin, the editor stays the same.

1. **Keeping Multiline** - We are sad that `multiline` is removed in newer version. It is a much friendlier approach than InnerBlock on blocks like Quote, List, etc.
