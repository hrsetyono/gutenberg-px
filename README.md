This plugin is a modified version of Gutenberg from WordPress 6.2, updated for compatibility with WP 6.7.

## Why Use This?

1. **Stable & Maintainable** - Prevents adding support for new styles due to Gutenberg changes on older project.

1. **Multiline Support** - We are sad that `multiline` is removed in newer version. It is much easier to use than InnerBlock on simple blocks like Quote.

FAQ:

1. Why is the version number so high (62.x)?

    Originally, I used 6.2.x to indicate itâ€™s based on Gutenberg from WP 6.2. However, WordPress would auto-deactivate the plugin during security updates, treating it as outdated. To prevent this, I set the version to 62.x.
